  ###### <h3> Overview
 
This repository contains codes of a novel approach to 3D human action recognition using self-organizing maps **3DHARSOM**, which addresses action classification problem by applying first and second orders of dynamics. Input dataset of actions generated by Kinect sensor [MSRAction3D](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/zliu/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Fzliu%2Factionrecorsrc%2F) is used to run experiments. **3DHARSOM** architecture is composed of a pre-processing layer, a first-layer SOM, a superimposition layer, a second-layer SOM and a third-layer neural network for labelling. Anyone interested in using **3DHARSOM** architecture and/or any of its components, please cite the following [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2017.06.007)/[arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06059):

###### <h3> Run experiment
Run HAR.py scripts and apply the settings required to define the dataset and hyperparameters used for either training or testing the system. A pretrained model is available in directory 'trained_models/MSR_Action3D_2_pretrained', which shows the performance of the system.
